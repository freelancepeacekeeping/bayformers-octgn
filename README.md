# bayformers-octgn

This is the first OCTGN fan set generated from Teletraan data. 

To install you will need to copy the GameDatabase and ImageDatabase folders into your OCTGN/Data directory (the one that already has a GameDatabase and ImageDatabase folder in). The idea being to add the new files in this GitHub repository to your local drive, but not to replace any existing files unless you've already installed these before.

Some known issues:

* 0 Defense/Attack for characters is an empty data value, not a 0 as is commonly the case in the TFTCG OCTGN data.
* Stratagems do not have Faction data set.
